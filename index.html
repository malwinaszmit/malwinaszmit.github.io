            <h2>Malwina is one of the best trainers I have had...</h2>
            <p>Over the years I wanted to lose weight and I took diet pills and wasted money on contracts at certain gyms, which was dead money as I never went and when I do it was a waste of time as all I did was mess about. Mal has changed all that and I've lost weight and had fun doing it!</p><br />
